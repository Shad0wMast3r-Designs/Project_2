Self Critique: It was fun working on this project and with Geldi Omeri and with Daniel Rybksi. I learned how to use github in terminal much better with this project. Setting our organizations url as the usptream and setting origin to the forked repostiroy allowed us to manage what got pushed to the porject and what could be pulled when there were issue. Overall I learned a lot with Professor Krieglstein with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I know the basic understanding of how a website should function and act when a user is browsing and looking around at all the items listed on the site itself. I could use some more practice with Mobile CSS I had some trouble with it but eventually I figured out how to resize everything and to fit on a mobile screen for all users. Final Note thank you Professor Krieglstein for teaching me how to design and implement websites it was a blast and I am comfortable enough to design sites for myself and the future.
